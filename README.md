This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Ruby where attempting to modify an instance variable within a getter method doesn't affect the instance variable's actual value.  The example shows a class with a getter method that seemingly modifies the instance variable, but this change is local to the getter and doesn't persist. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-debug issues. The solution showcases the proper way to modify an instance variable.
